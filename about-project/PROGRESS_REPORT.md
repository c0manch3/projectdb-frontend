  ProjectDetail = '/projects/:id',
  Employees = '/employees',
  Companies = '/companies',
  Workload = '/workload',
  Profile = '/profile',
  NotFound = '/404'
}
```

#### Protected Route Pattern
```typescript
// Authentication-based route protection
<Route 
  path={AppRoute.Projects} 
  element={
    <PrivateRoute authorizationStatus={authorizationStatus}>
      <Projects />
    </PrivateRoute>
  } 
/>
```

    logout, setCredentials, clearError
  }
});
```

#### Complete Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Working authentication with real backend
const loginUser = createAsyncThunk(
  'auth/loginUser',
  async (credentials: LoginCredentials) => {
    const response = await authAPI.login(credentials);
    localStorage.setItem('token', response.token);
    return response;
  }
);

// Protected route integration
<PrivateRoute>
  <Projects />
</PrivateRoute>
```
