  ProjectDetail = '/projects/:id',
  Employees = '/employees',
  Companies = '/companies',
  Workload = '/workload',
  Profile = '/profile',
  NotFound = '/404'
}
```

#### Protected Route Pattern
```typescript
// Authentication-based route protection
<Route 
  path={AppRoute.Projects} 
  element={
    <PrivateRoute authorizationStatus={authorizationStatus}>
      <Projects />
    </PrivateRoute>
  } 
/>
```

#### Component Library Structure
```
src/components/
├── app/ (1)           # Application root
├── common/ (9)        # Reusable UI components  
├── data_display/ (2)  # Data presentation
├── forms/ (4)         # Form controls
├── layout/ (2)        # Page layout
└── index.ts          # Clean exports
```

}
```

#### Redux State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Complete Redux store with TypeScript integration
interface RootState {
  auth: AuthState;
  projects: ProjectState;
  users: UserState;
  ui: UIState;
}

// Authentication slice with full login/logout flow
const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState: {
    user: null,
    token: null,
    isAuthenticated: false,
    loading: false,
    error: null
  },
  reducers: {
    loginStart, loginSuccess, loginFailure,
    logout, setCredentials, clearError
  }
});
```

#### Complete Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Working authentication with real backend
const loginUser = createAsyncThunk(
  'auth/loginUser',
  async (credentials: LoginCredentials) => {
    const response = await authAPI.login(credentials);
    localStorage.setItem('token', response.token);
    return response;
  }
);

// Protected route integration
<PrivateRoute>
  <Projects />
</PrivateRoute>
```

    // Redux error reporting integration
    store.dispatch(uiActions.setError({
      message: error.message,
      stack: error.stack
    }));
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Permission utility functions
export const canCreateProjects = (role: UserRole | null): boolean => {
  return ['Admin', 'Manager'].includes(role);
};

export const hasAdminPrivileges = (role: UserRole | null): boolean => {
  return isAdmin(role) || isManager(role);
};

// Component-level permissions
const canManageEmployees = currentUser?.role === 'Admin';
const canViewEmployees = ['Admin', 'Manager'].includes(currentUser?.role);
```

#### Complete Employee Management System
```typescript
// Advanced form validation with Zod
const createEmployeeSchema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().min(2, 'Имя должно содержать минимум 2 символа'),
  email: z.string().email('Неверный формат email адреса'),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^[\+\d\s\-\(\)]+$/, 'Неверный формат номера телефона'),
  dateBirth: z.string().refine((date) => new Date(date) < new Date(),
    'Дата рождения не может быть в будущем')
});

// React Hook Form integration
const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<FormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(createEmployeeSchema)
});

// Complete CRUD operations in Redux
export const createEmployee = createAsyncThunk(
  'users/createEmployee',
  async (employeeData: CreateEmployeeDto, { rejectWithValue }) => {
    try {
      const newEmployee = await employeesService.createEmployee(employeeData);
      return newEmployee;
    } catch (error: any) {
      return rejectWithValue(error.message);
    }
  }
);
```

#### Advanced Modal System
```typescript
// Custom modal components with full functionality
function AddEmployeeModal({ isOpen, onClose }: AddEmployeeModalProps) {
  const { register, handleSubmit, reset, formState: { errors, isSubmitting } } =
    useForm<FormData>({ resolver: zodResolver(createEmployeeSchema) });

  const onSubmit = async (data: FormData) => {
    try {
      await dispatch(createEmployee(data)).unwrap();
      toast.success('Сотрудник успешно создан');
      dispatch(fetchEmployees());

      throw new Error('Пароль должен содержать минимум 6 символов');
    }

    const response = await apiRequest.post<User>('/auth/register', employeeData);
    return response.data;
  },

  async getEmployeeStats(): Promise<EmployeeStats> {
    const employees = await this.getEmployees();
    return {
      total: employees.length,
      active: employees.length,
      managers: employees.filter(emp => emp.role === 'Manager').length,
